Some tribes take the rakshari not being chosen by any of the Ten to heart, and make their own religion, elaborate and secretive.

Heavier clothing is common here, swapping the flowy, covering desert robes for thicker fabric, often woven from the fur of the gotes that roam the mountain. These rakshari are isolated by happenstance, not by choice, and welcome traders who make the long journey to the mountains.

In modern days, access to resources is controlled by the Merchant-King of the region, but many rakshari are among the upper classes, old money. Many others are throughout the other social classes.

They have a stronger warrior culture than the other rakshari tribes, valuing strength and discipline. They may be standoffish to foreigners, but a bit friendlier to Zaladin citizens.
